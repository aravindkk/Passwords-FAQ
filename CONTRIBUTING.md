There are three ways you can help:

1.) Do you have a question about passwords and the login workflow that you want answered?
    
    Excellent! Raise an issue and we will add your question to the list.

2.) Do you have an answer to a question on the list?

    Awesome! Do a pull request and we will merge your answer to the repository.

3.) You might have wondered how this Q and A thing is going to work out. Or put simply, you might have wondered who is going to answer these questions. 

    We will update answers to these questions on a daily basis, but the quality of the answers can be kept high only if the repository is watched by great folks like you. Fork it, watch it, and let us know if you think an answer can be better.
